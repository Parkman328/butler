# Getting started

Sorry - there is no installer for Butler.  
You will need to work a bit on the command line to set things up.  

It's not as bad as it sounds though.  
Either you install a few pieces of software (most notably [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and some node modules), or you run Butler in a Docker container.  
Either way you also need to edit the configuration file and provide certificates exported from Qlik Sense Enterprise.

Follow the [installation and configuration instructions](install-config.md) - they will guide through the setup process, including requirements and customisation.

Then browse through [the examples](sample-code.md) to get an understanding of how to use Butler.
